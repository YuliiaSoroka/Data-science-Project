**Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Hotel Bookings**

**Overview**
This project is about hotel booking dynamics. It aims to predict whether a customer will honor or cancel their hotel reservation. By analyzing various factors such as the number of adults and children, stay duration, room type, and more, this study provides insights into customer behavior and booking patterns.

**Features of the Dataset**
The dataset contains several columns representing different aspects of hotel bookings, including:

Guest details (number of adults, children)\
Stay duration (weekend nights, weeknights)\
Booking specifics (meal plan, room type, lead time)\
Date of arrival (year, month, day)\
Booking history (previous cancellations, previous bookings not canceled)\
Financial aspects (average price per room, special requests)\

**Methodology**
The analysis involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.\
Application of statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square) to determine influential features.\
Building and evaluating predictive models using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.\
Comparing model performances and optimizing to enhance accuracy and F1-scores.

**Key Findings and Conclusion**
The project successfully develops models that can predict booking cancellations with a notable degree of accuracy. It highlights the significance of certain features in influencing booking decisions and offers a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior in the context of hotel reservations.

**Usage**
This notebook serves as a practical guide for data scientists interested in predictive modeling in the hospitality industry. It offers a methodology for approaching similar problems and can be adapted or expanded for further research.

**Requirements**
To run this notebook, you need Python 3.x, along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
